# Trip Management Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step plan for implementing trip management functionality in the Tabi travel app. The feature will allow users to create, edit, view, and delete trips with basic information like name, location, and dates.

## Current App State
- React Native/Expo app with Firebase authentication
- Existing navigation structure with Home, Login, Register screens
- Firebase configuration already set up
- Consistent design system with color themes and reusable components

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Setup & Data Models

#### Step 1: Firebase Firestore Configuration
- Add Firestore to the existing Firebase configuration
- Set up Firestore security rules for trip data
- Create trip collection structure with user-based access control

#### Step 2: Trip Data Model Design
Define trip schema with fields:
- `id` (auto-generated)
- `userId` (for user association)
- `name` (trip title)
- `location` (destination)
- `startDate` (trip start date)
- `endDate` (trip end date)
- `description` (optional trip notes)
- `createdAt` (timestamp)
- `updatedAt` (timestamp)
- `status` (planning, active, completed, cancelled)

#### Step 3: Trip Service Layer
- Create `src/services/trips.js` for all trip-related API calls
- Implement CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete
- Add real-time listeners for trip updates

### Phase 2: UI Components & Screens

#### Step 4: Trip List Screen
- Create `src/screens/TripsScreen.js` to display all user trips
- Implement trip cards with basic info (name, location, dates)
- Add pull-to-refresh functionality
- Include empty state for users with no trips

#### Step 5: Trip Detail Screen
- Create `src/screens/TripDetailScreen.js` for viewing individual trips
- Display comprehensive trip information
- Add edit and delete action buttons
- Show trip status and creation date

#### Step 6: Trip Form Components
- Create `src/screens/CreateTripScreen.js` for new trip creation
- Create `src/screens/EditTripScreen.js` for trip editing
- Build reusable form components for trip data input
- Add date picker components for start/end dates
- Implement form validation

#### Step 7: Trip Card Component
- Create `src/components/TripCard.js` for consistent trip display
- Include trip status indicators
- Add swipe actions for quick edit/delete
- Implement loading states

### Phase 3: Navigation & Integration

#### Step 8: Update Navigation
- Add new screens to `AppNavigator.js`
- Create trip-related navigation flows
- Update `HomeScreen.js` to link to trip management
- Add proper back navigation and screen titles

#### Step 9: Home Screen Integration
- Update existing "Create New Trip" and "View My Trips" buttons
- Add recent trips preview on home screen
- Show trip count and upcoming trips

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

#### Step 10: Trip Status Management
- Implement trip status updates (planning → active → completed)
- Add status-based filtering and sorting
- Create status change confirmation dialogs

#### Step 11: Search & Filter
- Add search functionality for trip names and locations
- Implement date range filtering
- Add status-based filtering options

#### Step 12: Trip Sharing (Optional)
- Add ability to share trip details
- Implement trip export functionality
- Create trip templates for common destinations

### Phase 5: Polish & Optimization

#### Step 13: Error Handling & Loading States
- Add comprehensive error handling for all trip operations
- Implement loading indicators and skeleton screens
- Add offline support with local caching

#### Step 14: Animations & UX
- Add smooth transitions between screens
- Implement swipe gestures for trip cards
- Add haptic feedback for important actions

#### Step 15: Testing & Validation
- Add unit tests for trip services
- Test all CRUD operations
- Validate form inputs and error states

## Technical Implementation Details

### Firebase Firestore Structure
```
trips/{tripId}
├── userId: string
├── name: string
├── location: string
├── startDate: timestamp
├── endDate: timestamp
├── description: string (optional)
├── status: string
├── createdAt: timestamp
└── updatedAt: timestamp
```

### Key Dependencies to Add
- `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` for date selection
- `react-native-vector-icons` for additional icons
- `react-native-gesture-handler` for swipe actions

### Security Rules
- Users can only access their own trips
- Read/write operations require authentication
- Trip data validation on the client and server side

### File Structure Changes
```
src/
├── services/
│   └── trips.js (new)
├── screens/
│   ├── TripsScreen.js (new)
│   ├── TripDetailScreen.js (new)
│   ├── CreateTripScreen.js (new)
│   └── EditTripScreen.js (new)
├── components/
│   └── TripCard.js (new)
└── navigation/
    └── AppNavigator.js (updated)
```

## Success Criteria
- Users can create new trips with name, location, and dates
- Users can view a list of all their trips
- Users can edit existing trip details
- Users can delete trips with confirmation
- Trip data persists across app sessions
- Real-time updates when trip data changes
- Consistent UI/UX with existing app design
- Proper error handling and loading states

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 1-2 days
- Phase 2: 3-4 days
- Phase 3: 1-2 days
- Phase 4: 2-3 days
- Phase 5: 1-2 days

**Total Estimated Time: 8-13 days**

## Notes
- This plan builds upon the existing app architecture
- Maintains consistency with current design patterns
- Leverages existing Firebase authentication
- Follows React Native best practices
- Prioritizes user experience and data security
