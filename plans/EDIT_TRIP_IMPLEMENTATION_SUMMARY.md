## Key Features Implemented

### Form Fields
1. **Trip Name:** Text input with validation (required, max 100 characters)
2. **Location:** Text input with validation (required, max 100 characters)
3. **Start Date:** Date picker with validation (required, minimum date today)
4. **End Date:** Date picker with validation (required, must be after start date)
5. **Description:** Multi-line text input (optional, max 500 characters)
6. **Status:** Dropdown/picker with status options (Planning, Active, Completed, Cancelled)
7. **Save/Cancel Buttons:** Primary and secondary actions

### Validation Rules
- Real-time validation using existing `TRIP_VALIDATION` rules
- Required field validation
- Character length constraints
- Date range validation (end date must be after start date)
- Error display with clear messaging

### User Experience
- Loading states during data fetching and save operations
- Confirmation dialogs for canceling with unsaved changes
- Success/error feedback with alerts
- Smooth navigation with back button support
- Platform-specific date picker behavior (iOS spinner, Android default)

### Technical Implementation
- Integration with existing trip services (`getTrip`, `updateTrip`)
- Authentication context integration for user identification
- Consistent styling with existing design system
- Proper error boundaries and error handling
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Dependencies Used
- `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` for date selection
- `@expo/vector-icons` for icons
- Existing trip services and validation rules
- Existing UI components (CustomInput, CustomButton, ScreenLayout)

## Testing Coverage
- ✅ Screen rendering tests
- ✅ Form validation tests
- ✅ API integration tests
- ✅ Error handling tests
- ✅ User interaction tests
- ✅ Navigation flow tests

## Integration Points
- Uses existing `getTrip` service to load trip data
- Uses existing `updateTrip` service to save changes
- Integrates with existing authentication context
- Follows existing design patterns and component structure
- Compatible with existing navigation structure

## Next Steps
The EditTripScreen is now ready for integration with:
1. **Navigation Structure** (Step 5) - Add to AppNavigator
2. **Trip Details Screen** (Step 1) - Add edit button navigation
3. **Trip List Integration** (Step 7) - Add edit functionality from trip cards

## Success Criteria Met
- ✅ Pre-populated form with current trip data
- ✅ Real-time validation using existing validation rules
- ✅ Date picker integration for start/end dates
- ✅ Status change functionality
- ✅ Save and cancel actions
- ✅ Loading states during save operations
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Consistent design with existing app patterns

## Notes
- The implementation follows the existing code patterns and design system
- All form validation uses the existing `TRIP_VALIDATION` rules
- Date pickers are platform-aware and provide native experience
- Status picker uses color-coded options for better UX
- Error handling provides clear feedback to users
- Tests ensure reliability and maintainability
