# Trip Sharing & Collaboration Feature Plan

## Overview
Enable users to share trips with other users, invite collaborators, and allow multiple users to view and edit the same trip in real-time.

## Core Features

### 1. Trip Sharing
- **Share Trip**: Users can share a trip with other users via email/username
- **Invitation System**: Send and manage invitations to collaborate on trips
- **Permission Levels**: Different access levels (View, Edit, Admin)
- **Public/Private Trips**: Option to make trips publicly discoverable

### 2. Collaboration
- **Real-time Editing**: Multiple users can edit trip simultaneously
- **Change Tracking**: Track who made what changes and when
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent edits gracefully
- **Activity Feed**: Show recent changes and activities

### 3. User Management
- **Trip Members**: List of users with access to the trip
- **Role Management**: Assign and change user roles
- **Remove Access**: Revoke user access to trips
- **Transfer Ownership**: Transfer trip ownership to another user
