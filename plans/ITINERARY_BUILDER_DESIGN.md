# Itinerary Builder Design Document

## Overview

The Itinerary Builder is a comprehensive day-by-day trip planning feature that allows users to create detailed schedules with drag-and-drop functionality, time slots, and categorized activities. This document outlines the design approach with versioned stages, where each version is a usable product that builds upon the previous one.

## Design Principles

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each version is fully functional and usable
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for mobile devices with touch interactions
- **Consistent UI**: Follows existing Tabi design patterns and color scheme
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering and smooth animations
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- **Offline Capable**: Works without internet connection
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of network failures and data conflicts
- **User Feedback**: Clear visual feedback for all user actions

## Color Scheme Integration

Using existing Tabi color palette:
- **Primary**: `#FF6B35` (Orange) - Main actions and highlights
- **Background**: `#FFFFFF`, `#F8FAFC`, `#F1F5F9` - Layered backgrounds
- **Text**: `#1E293B`, `#64748B`, `#475569` - Text hierarchy
- **Status Colors**: Success (`#059669`), Error (`#EF4444`), Warning (`#F59E0B`)
- **Borders**: `#E2E8F0`, `#CBD5E1` - Subtle separators

## Version 1.0: Basic Itinerary Structure

### Features
- Simple day-by-day view
- Add/remove days

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
```javascript
// ItineraryContext.js
const ItineraryContext = createContext();

const ItineraryProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [itinerary, setItinerary] = useState(null);
  const [selectedDay, setSelectedDay] = useState(0);
  const [dragState, setDragState] = useState(null);
  const [collaborators, setCollaborators] = useState([]);
  
  // ... context methods
};
```

### Database Schema
```javascript
// Firestore collections
itineraries: {
  id: string,
  tripId: string,
  title: string,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp,
  createdBy: string,
  collaborators: string[],
  days: Day[],
  settings: ItinerarySettings
}

activities: {
  id: string,
  dayId: string,
  title: string,
  startTime: string,
  endTime: string,
  category: string,
  location: GeoPoint,
  notes: string,
  photos: string[],
  comments: Comment[]
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large itineraries
- **Lazy Loading**: Load days on demand
- **Image Optimization**: Compress and cache photos
- **Offline Sync**: Queue changes when offline
- **Memory Management**: Clean up unused resources

### Accessibility Features
- **Screen Reader**: Full VoiceOver/TalkBack support
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order and shortcuts
- **High Contrast**: Support for accessibility settings
- **Font Scaling**: Dynamic text sizing
- **Voice Commands**: Basic voice control integration

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering and interactions (snapshot tests)
- State management logic (context and reducers)
- Utility functions (date/time calculations, validation)
- API service methods (Firestore, weather, AI services)
- Form validation and error handling
- Accessibility features (screen reader support)

### Integration Tests
- Drag-and-drop functionality (gesture recognition, drop zones)
- Real-time collaboration (Firebase listeners, conflict resolution)
- Data persistence (offline sync, error recovery)
- Export/import features (PDF generation, calendar integration)
- Category system and filtering
- Weather integration and caching

### E2E Tests
- Complete itinerary creation flow (add days, activities, edit, delete)
- Multi-user collaboration (invitations, real-time updates, permissions)
- Offline functionality (local storage, sync queue, conflict resolution)
- Performance benchmarks (large itineraries, smooth animations)
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)
- Accessibility compliance (VoiceOver/TalkBack)

### Performance Tests
- Large itinerary rendering (100+ activities)
- Real-time sync performance
- Animation frame rates (60fps target)
- Memory usage optimization
- Network request optimization

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Time spent in itinerary builder (target: 5+ minutes per session)
- Activities added per trip (target: 8+ activities per day)
- Collaboration usage (target: 30% of itineraries have collaborators)
- Export frequency (target: 25% of itineraries are exported)
- Feature adoption rate (target: 60% of users try drag-and-drop)

### Performance
- App load time < 2 seconds
- Smooth 60fps animations (target: 95% of interactions)
- Offline sync success rate > 95%
- Crash rate < 0.1%
- Memory usage < 100MB for large itineraries

### User Satisfaction
- Feature adoption rate (target: 70% of users use categories)
- User feedback scores (target: 4.5+ stars)
- Support ticket volume (target: < 5% of users)
- App store ratings (target: 4.5+ stars)
- User retention (target: 80% return within 30 days)

### Technical Metrics
- API response times < 500ms
- Real-time sync latency < 200ms
- Offline functionality success rate > 98%
- Accessibility compliance score > 95%
- Cross-platform consistency > 90%
- Support ticket volume
- App store ratings

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Support for 100+ activities per day
- Multi-language support
- Advanced analytics
- Enterprise features

### Integration Opportunities
- Booking platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com)
- Transportation apps (Uber, Lyft)
- Travel insurance providers

### Advanced Features
- AR navigation integration
- Voice-guided itineraries
- Predictive planning
- Machine learning personalization
