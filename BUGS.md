**Status:** In Progress  
**Component:** `AddActivityModal.js`

**Steps to Reproduce:**

## AI Planning

### 游리 Activities Generated for Limited Days Only
**Status:** Not Fixed  
**Component:** AI Trip Planning System  
**Description:** Activities are generated for only 2 days instead of being generated for all days in the trip duration.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create a trip with more than 2 days duration
2. Use AI trip planning to generate activities
3. Observe that activities are only generated for the first 2 days

**Expected Behavior:** Activities should be generated for all days of the trip duration
**Current Status:** Not fixed

### 游댮 Poor Handling of Invalid AI Responses
**Status:** Not Fixed  
**Component:** AI Response Processing  
**Description:** When the AI service returns invalid or malformed responses, the system fails without graceful error handling instead of providing user-friendly feedback or retry options.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Trigger AI trip planning with conditions that may cause invalid responses
2. Wait for AI to return malformed/invalid data
3. Observe system failure without proper error handling

**Expected Behavior:** Invalid AI responses should be handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback and recovery options
**Current Status:** Not fixed
